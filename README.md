Openshift Extras - Unofficial tools for use with OpenShift
==========================================================

This repository contains "odds and ends" for use with OpenShift servers
that we hope will prove useful, but are not a supported part of the
product (or, not yet).

The "master" branch is intended for use with current OpenShift Origin or
OpenShift Online servers. "enterprise-" branches are intended for use with
the corresponding OpenShift Enterprise version servers.
