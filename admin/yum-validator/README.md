# check-sources

This directory contains python libraries and tools for examining and repairing Yum repositories on a given system. In particular, `oo-admin-yum-validator` is designed to validate repository priorities and availability, with the goal of ensuring that OpenShift dependencies aren't overwritten by untested/unsupported versions of the same packages from other repositories.

## Installation

Right now, none as such.

Make sure that this directory is in your load path for Python, either by setting `PYTHONPATH`, modifying `sys.path`, or other methods.
