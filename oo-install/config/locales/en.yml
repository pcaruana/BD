  intro: >
    This installer will guide you through a basic system deployment,
    based on one of the scenarios below.
  vm_intro: >
    Choose option 1 to run the tutorial for administrators. Select from the other options to interact with your OpenShift Origin VM or deploy a whole separate OpenShift system.
  select_workflow: |-
    Select from the following installation scenarios.
    You can also type '?' for Help or 'q' to Quit
  info_wait_configuration_validation: >
    Please wait while your oo-install configuration is validated.
  info_deployment_validation: Validating deployment configuration...
  info_workflow_validation: Validating workflow configuration...
  info_subscription_validation: Validating subscription configuration...
  info_good_to_go: looks good.
  info_found_errors: 'validation failed:'
  info_force_run_deployment_setup: |-
    Your system deployment configuration is incomplete.
    The installer will guide you through the necessary configuration steps.
  info_force_run_subscription_setup: "Your subscription configuration is incomplete."
  info_force_run_dns_setup: "You must set some DNS-specific values."
  select_subscription: |-
    Choose from the following options to complete your subscription setup.
    You can also type '?' for Help or 'q' to return to the main menu."
  deployment_summary: "Here are the details of your current deployment."
  workflow_summary: "Here are your previous answers to the questions for this workflow."
  subscription_summary: "Here is the subscription configuration that the installer will use for this deployment."
  invalid_port_number_response: "Enter a valid port number in the range 1 to 65535"
  info_config_is_valid: "The deployment looks good."
  error_unattended_workflow_cfg: "The validation attempt uncovered errors. Rerun oo-install manually to correct them."
  info_unattended_workflow_start: "Everything looks good. Launching workflow."
  warning_ssh_issues: >
    Warning: The following host(s) cannot be accessed without a user-specifed password.
  unattended_not_possible: "This workflow cannot be run unattended."
  error_unattended_workflow_remote: >
    The following remote hosts are unreachable or require user-entered passwords.
  explain_subscriptions: >
    Subscription information is used to determine how your target host systems will
    get the necessary RPMs to install OpenShift.
  explain_none_subscriptions: >
    The "none" subscription option indicates that your systems already have
    the proper installation sources configured. It is your responsibility to
    ensure they are correct before beginning; the installer will not modify them.
  explain_yum_subscriptions: >
    The "yum" subscription option enables the installer to create and configure
    plain yum repositories. Any repositories specified will overwrite existing
    repositories of the same name in /etc/yum.repos.d
  explain_rhn_subscriptions: >
    The "rhn" subscription option re-registers the host from scratch
    using RHN Classic. Your login and password must be given to enable the necessary
    channels. You may also apply an activation key at registration.
  explain_rhsm_subscriptions: >
    The "rhsm" subscription option re-registers the host from scratch
    using Red Hat Subscription Manager. Your login and password must be given, as
    well as at least one pool ID for your OpenShift subscription. Multiple pool IDs
    may be provided as a comma-separated list.
  help_basic_deployment: |-
    These settings cover basic info for the target hosts in your OpenShift system. At a minimum, you must specify the host(s) on which the various OpenShift components will be installed and how DNS will be configured.

    The host roles are as follows:
    Broker: This is where the OpenShift broker, console, and nameserver are installed.
    MsgServer: This is where the ActiveMQ message server is installed.
    DBServer: This is where the broker's MongoDB server is installed.
    Node: This is where OpenShift applications are hosted.

    It is possible to install all of these components on the same host, but we strongly advise installing nodes on hosts separately from all other components.

    In order to install each host, we must have ssh access to it via the installer. You must provide:
      A host name or IP to ssh to
      A user on that host that either is root or can sudo without password

    Also provide a host name and IP address (may be internal-only). The nameserver installed with OpenShift will create records for these.

    The specific installation options that you've chosen may require additional settings.
  help_dns_deployment: |-
    OpenShift deals with DNS at two levels: the OpenShift hosts must
    be registered with DNS, but OpenShift-hosted apps are also
    registered with DNS as they get created.

    If you tell the installer to deploy a DNS service, this BIND
    instance will at a minimum be configured to serve the
    -application- domain and Node hosts will be configured to register
    new apps to that service using nsupdate. It can also be configured
    to work as the name server for the OpenShift component host
    systems in a separate zone or the same zone as the apps (not
    recommended).

    If you are already running a DNS service, and you want that
    system to handle the dynamic zone required for OpenShift apps,
    tell the installer -not to- deploy DNS. You will be asked to
    provide the IP address of your DNS server and a DNSSEC key
    value. These values will be used by OpenShift's Node hosts to
    register new hosted applications with your DNS service.
  help_subscription_cfg: >
    These are the subscription settings that are stored for future use
    in your configuration file.
  help_subscription_tmp: >
    These are the subscription settings that are only used for this installation
    and are not stored for future use in your configuration file.
  help_proceed_attended: >
    One or more of your target hosts will require user-entered passwords during
    the install process. If you want the process to run unattended, exit the
    installer and change the way the remote host authentication is handled, for
    instance using ssh-agent.
  help_workflow_questions: >
    These values will be used for the specific installation method
    that you have selected.
  help_hosts_edits: |-
    These settings cover the basic info for the host instance(s) in this OpenShift role.

    The host roles are as follows:
    Broker: This is where the OpenShift broker, console, and nameserver are installed. It should be accessible by app owners.
    MsgServer: This is where the ActiveMQ message server is installed. It needs to be accessible internally from the broker and nodes.
    DBServer: This is where the broker's MongoDB server is installed. It only needs to be accessible internally from the broker.
    Node: This is where OpenShift applications are hosted. It needs to be accessible by app owners and app users.
  menu_prompt: "Type a selection and press <return>:"
  basic_mode_explanation: |-
    Note: ActiveMQ and MongoDB will be installed on all Broker instances.
    For more flexibility, rerun the installer in advanced mode (-a).
  ip_config_help_text: This IP address information was found with a scan of the target system. If you would prefer to specify the necessary information manually, answer 'No'.
